# Max-Artificial-Intelligence
I want to create an Artificial Intelligence called max when I create more and public info I will added it here for people to enjoy

As this is my first ever attempt at an AI, If you have surggetstions with code I might implement the code into the AI

When ready of course the repository will be updated with the code and a public downloadable terminal will be added as soon as the AI runs

In a way I want this to be a community effort to see what amazing programers can do.

If you contibute I will add your name to the list.

Please note I will not take any credit to anywork anyone else adds to the project

Another thing this is designed in python though possibly can also add other languages and run thrm throught the main program.

I guess any forks that can be created will be Contributions and the code maybe added if no malware nor viruses are linked or programed in unless its for a security protocall to protect the AI with permission from the Contributers
